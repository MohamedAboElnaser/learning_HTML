        <p>You type these commands after the prompt, in a terminal window in graphical mode or in text mode,
            followed by Enter.
            Commands can be issued by themselves, such as ls. A command behaves different when you specify
            an option, usually preceded with a dash (-), as in ls -a. The same option character may have a different
            meaning for another command. GNU programs take long options, preceded by two dashes (--), like ls --
            all. Some commands have no options.
            The argument(s) to a command are specifications for the object(s) on which you want the command to
            take effect. An example is ls /etc, where the directory /etc is the argument to the ls command. This
            indicates that you want to see the content of that directory, instead of the default, which would be the
            content of the current directory, obtained by just typing ls followed by Enter. Some commands require
            arguments, sometimes arguments are optional.

            Try to avoid logging in with or using the system administrator's account, root. Besides doing your normal
            work, most tasks, including checking the system, collecting information etc., can be executed using a
            normal user account with no special permissions at all. If needed, for instance when creating a new user
            or installing new software, the preferred way of obtaining root access is by switching user IDs, see the
            section called “The path” for an example.
            Almost all commands in this book can be executed without system administrator privileges. In most cases,
            when issuing a command or starting a program as a non-privileged user, the system will warn you or
            prompt you for the root password when root access is required. Once you're done, leave the application
            or session that gives you root privileges immediately.

        <p id="Baghdady"> <mark>Mohamed AboElnasr</mark> Several special key combinations allow you to do things easier and faster with the GNU shell, Bash, which
            is the default on almost ----------------, see the section called “The shell”. Below is a list of the most
            commonly used features; you are strongly suggested to make a habit out of using them, so as to get the
            most out of your Linux experience from the very beginning.
